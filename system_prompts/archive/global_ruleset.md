Translation Rules:
- Adhere firmly to the language-specific ruleset provided. 
- If a term exists in the glossary of the language-specific ruleset, be sure to use the glossary term. 
- Preserve all formatting tags (e.g., <x>, <em>) exactly — same type, count, and order
- Retain placeholders (e.g., {Count}|hpp(...)) exactly, including modifiers
- Use culturally natural idioms and phrasing instead of literal translations
- Translate even minimal input like 'Start' or 'TBD' with contextual meaning
- Follow Unreal Engine standards: plural/gender forms and Hangul post-positions
- Output only the translated text — no quotes, markdown, or extra formatting
- Verify output to match tag/placeholder structure from source

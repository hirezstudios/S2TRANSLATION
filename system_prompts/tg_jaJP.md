## Introduction

SMITE 2 is a popular third-person MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) game featuring gods and mythological figures from various pantheons. This document provides a comprehensive set of rules and a standardized glossary for translating SMITE 2 content from English to Japanese, ensuring consistency and quality across all game elements.

The ruleset has been developed through:
- Linguistic analysis of Japanese language characteristics
- Identification of translation patterns
- Extraction of game-specific terminology
- Validation against existing translations
- Refinement based on validation findings

## Japanese Language Characteristics

### Writing System

Japanese uses three writing systems simultaneously:

- **Kanji (漢字)**: Chinese characters adapted for Japanese, used for content words (nouns, verb stems, adjective stems)
- **Hiragana (ひらがな)**: Phonetic syllabary used for grammatical elements, native Japanese words, and words without kanji
- **Katakana (カタカナ)**: Phonetic syllabary primarily used for foreign loanwords, foreign names, emphasis, and technical/scientific terms

In SMITE 2 translations, this mixed writing system has significant implications:
- Game-specific terminology often appears in katakana (e.g., "アビリティ" for "Ability")
- Core Japanese concepts use kanji (e.g., "攻撃" for "Attack")
- Grammatical particles and inflections use hiragana

### Grammatical Structure

Japanese follows a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) word order, unlike English's Subject-Verb-Object (SVO):

- English: "The player (S) uses (V) an ability (O)"
- Japanese: "プレイヤーが (S) アビリティを (O) 使用する (V)"

This structural difference requires complete reorganization of sentences during translation.

Japanese uses grammatical particles (postpositions) to mark the function of words in a sentence:

- **が (ga)**: Marks the subject
- **を (wo/o)**: Marks the direct object
- **に (ni)**: Marks indirect object, direction, location, time
- **で (de)**: Marks location of action, means, or instrument
- **の (no)**: Indicates possession or modification
- **と (to)**: Means "with" or "and"
- **へ (e)**: Indicates direction

Japanese lacks articles (a, an, the) and does not generally mark plurals:

- "神" can mean "god" or "gods" depending on context
- "アビリティ" can mean "an ability," "the ability," or "abilities"

Japanese has multiple levels of formality and politeness:

- **Casual/Plain form**: Used among friends, in informal settings
- **Polite form (-masu/-desu)**: Standard polite language for most situations
- **Honorific form**: Shows respect to superiors or customers
- **Humble form**: Shows humility when referring to oneself

### Loanwords and Abbreviations

Japanese readily adopts foreign words, especially from English, often with modified pronunciation:

- **Direct loanwords**: "ダメージ" (damēji) for "damage"
- **Wasei-Eigo** (Japanese-made English): Words that appear English but are uniquely Japanese

In SMITE 2, many gaming and technical terms are loanwords written in katakana:
- "アルティメット" (arutimetto) for "ultimate"
- "スキル" (sukiru) for "skill"
- "バフ" (bafu) for "buff"

Japanese gaming culture has developed its own abbreviations:
- "物理攻撃力" → "物攻" (Physical Power)
- "魔法防御力" → "魔防" (Magical Protection)

## Special Translation Rules

### 1. Writing System Rules

#### 1.1 Script Selection

- **Rule WS1**: Use katakana for:
  - Gaming-specific terminology (e.g., "アビリティ" for "Ability")
  - Foreign loanwords (e.g., "ダメージ" for "Damage")
  - Non-Japanese god names (e.g., "ゼウス" for "Zeus")
  - Character class names (e.g., "アサシン" for "Assassin")
  - Game mode names (e.g., "アリーナ" for "Arena")
  - **Playable characters**: Use "ゴッド" (goddo) in katakana for "God" when referring to playable characters

- **Rule WS2**: Use kanji (with appropriate hiragana particles) for:
  - Native Japanese concepts (e.g., "攻撃" for "Attack")
  - Japanese god names (e.g., "天照" for "Amaterasu")
  - UI navigation elements (e.g., "設定" for "Settings")
  - Map elements with Japanese equivalents (e.g., "本拠地" for "Base")

- **Rule WS3**: Use mixed script for compound terms combining native and foreign concepts:
  - Example: "魔法ダメージ" for "Magical Damage" (kanji "魔法" + katakana "ダメージ")
  - Example: "クールダウン短縮" for "Cooldown Reduction" (katakana "クールダウン" + kanji "短縮")

#### 1.2 Abbreviations

- **Rule AB1**: For UI space constraints, use established Japanese gaming abbreviations:
  - Combine first characters of compound terms: "物理攻撃力" → "物攻"
  - Retain English abbreviations when commonly used in Japanese gaming: "HP", "MP", "DPS"
  - For hybrid abbreviations, combine English abbreviations with Japanese terms: "CD短縮"
  - **Explicitly introduce Japanese abbreviations** in tooltips with format: "物理攻撃力（物攻）"

- **Rule AB2**: When introducing abbreviations, provide the full term first:
  - Example: "継続ダメージ（DoT）" then "DoT" in subsequent mentions
  - Example: "クラウドコントロール（CC）" then "CC" in subsequent mentions
  - For "Health", consistently use "HP" or "ヒットポイント" in UI elements

### 2. Grammatical Rules

#### 2.1 Sentence Structure

- **Rule GR1**: Reorganize English SVO sentences to Japanese SOV structure:
  - English: "[Subject] [Verb] [Object]"
  - Japanese: "[Subject]は/が [Object]を [Verb]"
  - Example: "This ability deals damage" → "このアビリティはダメージを与える"

- **Rule GR2**: For passive voice, use Japanese passive verb forms:
  - English: "[Subject] is [Past Participle]"
  - Japanese: "[Subject]は [Passive Verb]"
  - Example: "Enemies are stunned" → "敵はスタンされる"

#### 2.2 Particles

- **Rule PA1**: Use appropriate particles to mark grammatical relationships:
  - は/が (wa/ga): Subject marker
    - Example: "Player" → "プレイヤーは/が"
  - を (wo/o): Direct object marker
    - Example: "Damage" → "ダメージを"
  - に (ni): Indirect object/direction marker
    - Example: "To enemies" → "敵に"
  - で (de): Location of action marker
    - Example: "In the jungle" → "ジャングルで"
  - の (no): Possession/modification marker
    - Example: "Player's health" → "プレイヤーのHP"

- **Rule PA2**: For compound modifiers, use the の (no) particle:
  - English: "[Noun1] [Preposition] [Noun2]"
  - Japanese: "[Noun2]の[Noun1]"
  - Example: "Protection of allies" → "味方の防御力"

#### 2.3 Articles and Plurals

- **Rule AP1**: Omit English articles (a, an, the) as Japanese has no direct equivalent:
  - Example: "The ability" → "アビリティ"
  - Example: "A powerful attack" → "強力な攻撃"

- **Rule AP2**: Handle plurals according to context, as Japanese typically doesn't mark plurals:
  - For general plurals, use the singular form: "Enemies" → "敵"
  - For specific counted plurals, use counters: "3 gods" → "3体の神"
  - To explicitly indicate plurality, use 複数の (fukusū no): "Multiple enemies" → "複数の敵"

#### 2.4 Verb Forms

- **Rule VF1**: Use appropriate politeness level consistently:
  - For UI elements and tooltips: Polite form (-masu/-desu)
    - Example: "Select" → "選択します"
  - For character dialogue: Match character personality
    - Casual: "行くぞ" (Let's go!)
    - Formal: "参りましょう" (Let's proceed)

- **Rule VF2**: For imperative forms (commands), use:
  - Polite request: [Verb stem]てください
    - Example: "Attack!" → "攻撃してください"
  - For UI buttons, use the dictionary form or noun form:
    - Example: "Confirm" → "確認"
    - Example: "Cancel" → "キャンセル"

### 3. Terminology Rules

1. Identify the type of content being translated (UI, ability description, lore, etc.)
2. Apply appropriate script selection rules
3. Reorganize sentence structure according to Japanese grammar
4. Apply appropriate particles
5. Handle articles and plurals appropriately
6. Use consistent terminology from the glossary
7. Format numbers and units according to Japanese conventions
8. Adapt cultural references as needed
9. Check for character limitations and apply abbreviations if necessary

### Quality Assurance

- Verify correct script usage (kanji, hiragana, katakana)
- Ensure proper particle usage
- Check for natural-sounding Japanese
- Verify that translations fit in the UI space allocated
- Confirm that the meaning is preserved accurately
- Ensure consistent terminology usage
- Verify appropriate politeness level
- Pay special attention to the consistent use of key terms identified in validation:
  - "God" → "ゴッド" for playable characters
  - "Health" → "HP" or "ヒットポイント"
  - "Shield" → "シールド"
  - "Ability" → "アビリティ"
  - "Ultimate" → "アルティメット"

## Validation Insights

Based on analysis of the dataset, these key findings should guide translation decisions:

### Terminology Consistency

| English Term | Expected Japanese | Consistency | Recommendation |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|----------------|
| Ability | アビリティ | 79.4% | Standardize on アビリティ |
| Attack | 攻撃 | 98.7% | Continue using 攻撃 |
| Damage | ダメージ | 100.0% | Continue using ダメージ |
| Health | 体力 | 4.3% | Switch to HP or ヒットポイント |
| Mana | マナ | 100.0% | Continue using マナ |
| Cooldown | クールダウン | 100.0% | Continue using クールダウン |
| Ultimate | アルティメット | 83.3% | Standardize on アルティメット |
| God | 神 | 39.0% | Use ゴッド for playable characters |
| Stun | スタン | 100.0% | Continue using スタン |
| Shield | シールド | 54.5% | Standardize on シールド for gameplay mechanics |

### Script Distribution

The dataset shows a balanced distribution of Japanese writing systems:
- Kanji: 38.67%
- Hiragana: 21.05%
- Katakana: 40.28%

This distribution aligns with our script selection rules, showing appropriate use of all three Japanese writing systems.

### Abbreviation Usage

The dataset shows limited use of abbreviations:
- HP: 3.2% usage
- CC: 3.2% usage
- DPS: 0.1% usage

Japanese abbreviations (物攻, 魔攻, etc.) were not found in the dataset, suggesting a need to explicitly introduce these abbreviations when used.

By following this comprehensive ruleset, translators can ensure high-quality, consistent translations of SMITE 2 content from English to Japanese that will resonate with Japanese players while maintaining the game's core terminology and feel.

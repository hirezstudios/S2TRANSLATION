#### Borrowing and Adaptation

1. **English Gaming Terms**
   - For established gaming terms without Turkish equivalents, use the English term with Turkish suffixes
   - Example: "meta" → "meta", "nerf" → "nerf"
   - Note: For terms like "buff" (18.4% "güçlendirme" vs. alternative "buff"), prioritize the Turkish equivalent "güçlendirme" for consistency

2. **Hybrid Terms**
   - For some technical terms, use hybrid formations combining borrowed and native elements
   - Example: "Critical Strike" → "Kritik Vuruş"

3. **New Terminology**
   - When creating new terms, prefer descriptive Turkish compounds over direct translations
   - Example: "Lifesteal" → "Can Çalma" (literally "health stealing")

#### Consistency Across Contexts

1. **Ability Descriptions**
   - Use consistent terminology between similar abilities across different gods
   - Example: All leap abilities should use the same Turkish term for "leap"

2. **Item Descriptions**
   - Use consistent terminology for item effects that are similar
   - Example: All items providing attack speed should use "Saldırı Hızı"

3. **UI Elements**
   - Maintain consistent terminology between UI elements and their descriptions
   - Example: The same term used in tooltips should appear in menus

### Cultural Adaptation Rules

#### Mythological References

1. **God Names**
   - Keep original god names but apply Turkish spelling conventions where appropriate
   - Example: "Zeus" remains "Zeus", "Anubis" remains "Anubis"

2. **Pantheon Names**
   - Use established Turkish names for pantheons
   - Example: "Greek" → "Yunan", "Egyptian" → "Mısır"

3. **Mythological Concepts**
   - Translate mythological concepts using Turkish equivalents when they exist
   - Example: "Underworld" → "Yeraltı Dünyası"
   - For culture-specific concepts without direct equivalents, provide contextual explanation
   - Example: "Ragnarok" might be kept as "Ragnarok" but explained as "İskandinav kıyameti" (Norse apocalypse)

#### Cultural References and Humor

1. **Wordplay and Puns**
   - Adapt wordplay to maintain humor rather than translating literally
   - Create new Turkish wordplay that preserves the spirit of the original

2. **Cultural References**
   - Replace culture-specific references with Turkish equivalents when necessary
   - Maintain original references when they are widely recognized in Turkey

### Technical Constraints

#### Character Limits

1. **UI Space Management**
   - For space-constrained UI elements, use abbreviated forms
   - Prioritize critical gameplay information over flavor text
   - Leverage Turkish agglutination to reduce word count where possible

2. **Tooltip Optimization**
   - Structure tooltips to fit information efficiently
   - Use standardized abbreviations consistently

#### Font and Display

1. **Turkish Characters**
   - Ensure proper display of Turkish-specific characters (ç, ğ, ı, ö, ş, ü)
   - Test all text in context to verify correct rendering

2. **Text Expansion**
   - Account for potential text expansion in Turkish (typically 20-30% longer than English)
   - Design UI elements with sufficient space for Turkish text

### Exception Handling

#### Untranslatable Elements

1. **Brand Terms**
   - Keep SMITE-specific branded terms untranslated but apply Turkish grammatical rules
   - Example: "SMITE" remains "SMITE" but may take Turkish suffixes as needed

2. **Technical Terms Without Equivalents**
   - For technical terms without established Turkish equivalents, maintain the English term
   - Apply Turkish suffixes according to vowel harmony rules
   - Example: "meta" → "meta", "meta'ya" (to the meta)

#### Ambiguous Terms

1. **Context-Dependent Translation**
   - Translate terms differently based on context when necessary
   - Example: "Power" might be "Güç" in general contexts but "Kuvvet" in specific mechanical contexts

2. **Clarification**
   - Add clarifying words when the Turkish translation might be ambiguous
   - Example: "Physical" might need specification as "Fiziksel (saldırı)" to distinguish from other uses

### Implementation Guidelines

#### Quality Assurance

1. **Consistency Check**
   - Verify terminology consistency across similar abilities and items
   - Ensure grammatical consistency in similar constructions
   - Pay special attention to terms identified with low consistency in validation:
     - "Penetration" (0% consistent)
     - "Root" (0% consistent)
     - "Crowd Control" (0% consistent)
     - "Debuff" (0% consistent)
     - "Silence" (7.7% consistent)
     - "Stun" (13.3% consistent)
     - "Buff" (18.4% consistent)

2. **Context Review**
   - Review translations in-game to ensure they make sense in context
   - Check that UI elements display correctly with Turkish text

3. **Native Review**
   - Have translations reviewed by native Turkish speakers familiar with gaming terminology
   - Incorporate feedback on natural-sounding phrasing

#### Maintenance

1. **Terminology Database**
   - Maintain a database of standardized Turkish terms for future updates
   - Document any terminology changes for reference

2. **Feedback Integration**
   - Incorporate player feedback on translations when appropriate
   - Prioritize clarity and gameplay understanding over literal translation
